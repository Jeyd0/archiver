## Troubleshooting

**Q: My profile README isn't showing up**
- Make sure the repository name exactly matches your username (case-sensitive)
- Ensure the repository is public
- The file must be named `README.md` (case-sensitive)
- The README.md must be in the root of the repository

**Q: The GitHub stats aren't showing**
- The stats are generated dynamically and may take a moment to load
- If they still don't appear, check that your username is spelled correctly in the URL

**Q: How do I update my profile README?**
- Simply edit the README.md file in your `Jeyd0/Jeyd0` repository
- Changes will appear on your profile immediately after committing
